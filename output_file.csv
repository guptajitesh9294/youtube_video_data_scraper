Myositis is generally referred to a group of inflammatory muscle disorders. These are autoimmune diseases, in which the immune system of the body attacks the muscles, causing inflammation, weakening and damage.

Diagnosis usually involves physical examination of muscle strength, blood tests for muscle enzymes, electrical tests of muscle and nerves, and is confirmed by muscle biopsy.

✔️ Causes of Myositis
Myositis could be a result of an infection, injury, certain medications, strenuous exercise, chronic disease or occur due to certain autoimmune diseases.

✔️ Classification of Myositis
Inflammatory myopathies (myositis) can present in patients in several forms, like, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and inclusion body myositis. However, in some cases, the symptoms are converging and cannot be elucidated into just one type, that case is called overlap myositis.

✔️ Polymyositis
Polymyositis is a chronic illness featuring progressive muscle weakness. The educator goes into details of the pathogenesis, clinical features and the diagnosis it via physical examination, elevated serum muscle enzymes, electromyography (EMG) and muscle biopsy.

✔️ Dermatomyositis
Polymyositis can be associated with a characteristic skin rash and is then referred to as ""dermatomyositis."" It is often referred to as a systemic illness, as it can also affect other areas of the body like the esophagus, joints, lungs, and heart. Its etiology may include infections, medications, genetic factors, and multiple environmental factors.

✔️ Inclusion Body Myositis
Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is also a type of myositis. The muscle biopsy in IBM displays clear areas within the muscle cells, called vacuoles, when viewed under the magnification of a microscope.

✔️ Overlap Myositis
There are a few associated conditions which may mimic the symptoms of myositis. These include a few muscle dystrophies, , certain myopathies, drug induced conditions of the muscles and other muscle degeneration syndromes like Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)  and Myasthenia Gravis.

Depending on which other diseases it is associated with, it may be referred to as an ""overlap syndrome"" or ""mixed connective tissue disease.""

✔️ Treatment of Myositis
No proper treatment of myositis exists, due to poor understanding and lack of response to current medications. But its symptoms can be managed using corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs.
